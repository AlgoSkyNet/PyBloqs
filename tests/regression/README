Regression tests create various reports and compare them to reports created previously.
These tests are useful to check that a change does not affect block types that should not have changed.
When making changes to the code, some of the reports should look differently. The report base used to check against needs to be updated. 

To update a single block type (e.g. table):
1) Go to tests/regression/block/
2) Run "python test_table.py"

To update all block types, for example after changing base block:
Run "python update_all.py"
